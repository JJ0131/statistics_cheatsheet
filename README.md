# statistics_cheatsheet

## This is my version of the [MIT statistics cheatsheet](https://web.mit.edu/~csvoss/Public/usabo/stats_handout.pdf)

I'm re-writting this cheatsheet in Python as a practice for both python and statistics. But I'm also adding more to the cheatsheet.

I'm planning to add caveats like:

* assumptions of those concepts (e.g. t-test assume normal distribution)
* when to use those tests (e.g. use Z test when sample size is bigger than 30)

Good luck to me!
